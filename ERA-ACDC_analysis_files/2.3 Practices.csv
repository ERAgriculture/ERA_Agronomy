b31,Crop Management,Crop Management,Crop Rotation,,Intercrop Rotation,,Rotation (Int Only),Int Only,"Rotation where a main crop remains the same between seasons (no change in spatial location or crop identity), but the minor intercrop is not always present. If the same crop is intercropped throughout the sequence (e.g. Maize-Beans/Maize/Maize-Beans) then this requires a Partial Intercropping code (b50.1, b50.2 or b50.3) or if the intercrop changes throughout the sequence (e.g. Maize-Beans/Maize-Millet/Maize-Beans) this requires a Complex Intercrop Rotation code (b57). If the intercrop is mostly one crop for a long sequence, but rarely something else is planted, we still consider this to be relevant to the Partial Intercropping code.
A general definition of rotation is that more than one crop is grown in the same location, but across different growing season (diversification in time). Different varieties of the same crop do not count as rotation. A crop is not counted in a rotation sequence when it is obviously a minor intercrop to a main crop which is invariant over time (typically there is standard planting of the main crop from year to year and the intercrop is squeezed in-between the rows of the main crop, for example cowpea planted at a low density inbetween maize rows).
