# Overview

As part of the **ERA Synthesis for the Agroecology in the Dry Corridor of Central America (ACDC) project**, we conducted a multi-day training for the data extraction team. The sessions introduced participants to the ERA meta-analysis framework, systematic workflows, and the tools used to extract and manage agricultural research data.

The training covered: - The ERA workflow (screening, extraction, and quality control) - Master codes for practices, outcomes, and experimental units - Hands-on use of tools like Slack, Colandr, Zotero, and the ERA data entry platform - Practical exercises to build familiarity with agronomic data extraction and uncertainty handling

Over several sessions, participants were introduced to the full ERA data workflow—from screening studies to extracting site and practice data—while learning how to apply master codes and use modern research tools. The training combined theoretical sessions with practical exercises and team-based learning.


# Learning Objectives

Participants were expected to:
- Understand the purpose and structure of the ERA meta-analysis.
- Apply the ERA workflow, including screening, data extraction, and quality control.
- Familiarize themselves with master codes covering experimental units, practices, and outcomes.
- Gain practical experience using tools such as Slack, Zotero, Colandr, and the ERA submission platform.
- Improve their ability to extract agronomic and geographic data, including managing uncertainty in site coordinates.


# Tools & Platforms Used

- **ERA Submission UI:** for structured data entry
- **Colandr:** for literature screening
- **Zotero:** for organizing scientific publications
- **Slack:** for communication and troubleshooting
- **Google Sheets:** for practice and outcome master codes
- **WebPlotDigitizer:** for extracting data from graphs
- **Google Drive / SharePoint:** for sharing training materials and video tutorials


# Training Syllabus
An important part of the training was the use of **video tutorials** linked to each section of the ERA data entry process. These videos covered core components such as site information, agronomic practices (e.g., fertilizer, irrigation, tillage), and outcomes. They enabled participants to refer back to the on how to use ERA user interface at any time and reinforced the hands-on learning approach with clear, repeatable guidance.

The training covered the full ERA workflow—from screening studies to extracting site and practice data—while introducing the master codes and modern research tools that support consistency and quality control.
