<p><em>Evidence for Resilient Agriculture</em> (ERA) v1.0.1 helps address the gap. Started in 2012, ERA was envisaged to evaluate the evidence base of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)—that is, agriculture that delivers productivity, resilience, and climate change mitigation outcomes simultaneously. However, the technologies included within ERA such as agroforestry, intercropping, and crop rotations, among many others are common features of agroecology, regenerative agriculture, nature-based solutions, ecosystem-based adaptation, sustainable land management, and other approaches as are many of the outcome indicators such as yield, net economic returns, soil organic carbon, land equivalent ratio, labour required, and more. This means that ERA is relevant for various perspectives on development and is flexible to allow users to define ‘effectiveness’ or ‘work’ consistently with their worldview.</p>
<p>ERA is a comparatively large agricultural meta-dataset in terms of number of technologies, outcomes, and studies. ERA v1.0.1 includes data from 2,011 agricultural experiments that took place in Africa between 1934 and 2018. Together, these data compare how changing more than 364 combinations of agronomic, livestock, or tree management technologies affect more than 87 indicators of productivity, resilience, and greenhouse gas emissions and/or carbon stocks. The experiments were identified via <em>Web of Science</em> and <em>Scopus</em> and were evaluated against predetermined inclusion criteria: (i) location, (ii) technology and outcome relevance, (iii) data on both a new and conventional technology, and (iv) inclusion of primary data. Extracted data from over 3,000 studies include 135 fields describing each study’s context, experimental design, management treatments (i.e., which are combinations of technologies used), and outcomes.</p>

<section id="extraction-template" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extraction-template"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Extraction template</h2>
<p>Over the years of ERA, several versions of the extraction template have been developed. However, the most widely used and thoroughly tested version is the Excel macro-enabled workbook. In this format, each study is documented in a separate Excel file, with individual tabs dedicated to different components of the study—such as site information, soil characteristics, management practices, and outcomes. The work book contains the following sections:<br>
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pub = Publication: capture bibliographic data about an experiment here.</p></li>
<li><p>Site &amp; Site Soils = captures information about experimental sites, any detailed information about soil variables should be captured in Site.Soils</p></li>
<li><p>ExpD = Experimental design, captures information about the number of study replicates, plot sizes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Practices (pale yellow tabs) = These tabs collect information about the agricultural management practices used in an experiment. Within tabs you can record base practices which apply to all treatments (e.g.&nbsp;50kg of 60-30-30 NPK was applied to all treatments) or experimental practices that different between treatments (e.g.&nbsp;one treatment used straw mulch and another did not). Each set of experimental practices within a practice tab creates named building blocks that you will combine in the Make.Trt tab to create treatments. Base practices you do not need to consider again once they are entered in the practice tabs, they also do not require naming as the spreadsheet should autopopulate the name field with “base”.</p>
<p>Many practice tabs will require you to select and name a practice method that relates to a code in ERA practice definitions, this part of the data entry is critical. After you have chosen a method and named a practice you can often scroll down to tables that can collect more detail information about how the practice was implemented. There are also notes sections where you can copy paste important experimental information that you do no think the workbook captures well. Each tab is a theme that represents a set of related practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chems = Chemical applications (applications of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Harvest = Harvest methods &amp; timing Irrigat = Irrigation methods &amp; application rates</p></li>
<li><p>Mulch = Materials that are not from crops in the experimental plot (record these in the residues tab) applied to the surface of the plot as a mulch. Records the type of mulch &amp; application details . Does not include compost or manures (use the nutrients tab).</p></li>
<li><p>Nutrients = Inputs/fertilizers added to a plot designed to improve/increase/provide nutrients for crop growth. Nutrients can include inorganic fertilizers, compost, manure, micronutrients, biochar, biofertilizers, biosolids and other organic amendments. Records the type of fertilizer &amp; application details.</p></li>
<li><p>Comp = Composition of organic mulch or nutrient materials.</p></li>
<li><p>pH = Materials &amp; application rates of materials used for amendment of soil pH (e.g.&nbsp;liming).</p></li>
<li><p>Plant = Planting methods &amp; timing Residues = Fate of crop residues &amp; compositional details.</p></li>
<li><p>Tillage = Tillage method(s) used &amp; details of tillage operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Variety = Crop varieties used &amp; information on their basic traits.</p></li>
<li><p>WaterHarvest = Water harvesting methods (e.g., planting basins, terraces, tied ridges, zai pits, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Weed = Physical (not chemical) weeding events (typically hand weeding).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make.Trt = create &amp; name treatments by combining the experimental practices entered in the practice tabs.</p></li>
<li><p>EU&amp;Out = Experimental Unit &amp; Outcomes: Choose the products (typically crop commodities) and experimental outcomes for which data are presented.</p></li>
<li><p>Times = Select the cropping seasons or years for which data are presented.</p></li>
<li><p>EnterData = Captures values and associated errors for the experimental treatments, products, outcomes and times specified in the previous tabs. Do not start data entry until you’ve completed all the previous tabs.</p></li>

<p>The above tables are what we refer to as the data tables, or raw data within ERA. These tables provide you with <strong>detail information</strong> from each study, e.g fertilizer applied, timing of fertilizer and so on. In an attempt to make the data easily usable, ERA.Compiled is created.<br>
ERA.Compiled is a flat excel file that pulls <strong>only essential fields</strong> from each data tables table to create rows of <strong>treatment versus control. This treatment versus control data excluded detailed description of management practices.</strong> It simply captures the ‘with’ or ‘without’ a practice.</p>
<p>Below is a simple conceptional framework of how ERA.Compiled is generated from the data tables.</p>

Source: AGROVOC","Also called Soil Density. Soil bulk density is the weight of soil per unit volume, expressed in g/cm3 or Mg/m3, and is an indicator of soil compaction or looseness, which affects root growth, water infiltration, and nutrient availability.","Content or amount of total carbon in soil, including organic carbon and carbon from lime. Source: AGROVOC","Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is a measure of the amount of carbon present in the soil in the form of organic matter, such as dead plant and animal material, that has not yet decomposed into inorganic carbon dioxide. SOC content is expressed as a percentage or weight of carbon per unit of soil mass and is a critical indicator of soil health and fertility. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a component of soil organic matter (SOM) and represents the carbon-containing fraction of SOM.","Soil organic matter (SOM) content, includes both living and dead organic matter in the soil, such as plant roots, microorganisms, and decomposing organic materials. SOM is a more comprehensive measure of the total organic matter in the soil (than SOC), including both the stable and labile fractions, and is a key indicator of soil quality and productivity. While SOC is a subset of SOM, SOM takes into account the complex interactions among different organic matter components and soil properties, making it a more comprehensive indicator of soil health.","Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, expressed as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (pH scale ranges from 0 to 14). The pH scale is logarithmic, so each whole number represents a tenfold difference in acidity or alkalinity. Soil pH is a critical parameter for soil fertility and plant growth, as it influences nutrient availability, microbial activity, and soil structure.","Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) is a measure of the soil's ability to hold positively charged ions, known as cations, and is expressed as the number of milliequivalents of cations per 100 grams of soil. CEC is a critical parameter for soil fertility, as it influences the soil's ability to retain and supply essential plant nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. While CEC and EC are both indicators of soil health and fertility, CEC relates to the soil's nutrient-holding capacity, while EC reflects the level of soil salinity.","Electrical Conductivity (EC), is a measure of the soil's ability to conduct electrical charges and is expressed as the amount of electrical current that passes through a soil sample. EC is related to the concentration of soluble salts in the soil, and high EC values can indicate soil salinity, which can be detrimental to crop growth and yield. While CEC and EC are both indicators of soil health and fertility, CEC relates to the soil's nutrient-holding capacity, while EC reflects the level of soil salinity.","Soil water holding capacity (WHC) is the maximum amount of water that a given volume of soil can hold against the force of gravity, usually expressed as the amount of water retained per unit of soil depth or volume. The water holding capacity of a soil depends on its texture, structure, organic matter content, and compaction, and is a critical factor for plant growth and productivity, particularly in areas with limited or erratic rainfall.","Content or amount of total nitrogen in soil.

Different varieties of the same crop do not count as rotation. A crop is not counted in a rotation sequence when it is obviously a minor intercrop to a main crop which is invariant over time (typically there is standard planting of the main crop from year to year and the intercrop is squeezed in-between the rows of the main crop, for example cowpea planted at a low density inbetween maize rows).","A crop rotation sequence with two or more non-legumes.\r\nA general definition of rotation is that more than one crop is grown in the same location, but across different growing season (diversification in time).

Different varieties of the same crop do not count as rotation. A crop is not counted in a rotation sequence when it is obviously a minor intercrop to a main crop which is invariant over time (typically there is standard planting of the main crop from year to year and the intercrop is squeezed in-between the rows of the main crop, for example cowpea planted at a low density inbetween maize rows).","A crop rotation sequence with three or more species or rotations with different annual cycles.

If it is not clear which crops are main or minor or not then count them all towards a complex rotation total (so an experiement might have maize one year, then the next year some maize rows are replaced with beans, in this case the beans are counted as a rotation crop and the number of species is two). \r\nA general definition of rotation is that more than one crop is grown in the same location, but across different growing season (diversification in time).

If the intercrop is mostly one crop for a long sequence, but rarely something else is planted, we still consider this to be relevant to the Partial Intercropping code.\r\nIntercropping is where more than one crop is grown at the same time in the same area of management (typically a single field), this is diversification in space rather than diversification in time.

This can be used to describe pasture biomass yields or when total, above ground, or below ground biomass yields are given for crops that are usually split into product and non-product parts on harvest.","Extraction yield of oil from oil seeds or similar. For example 300kg oil extracted from 1000kg oil seeds = 0.3 or 30% oil yield per kg oil seeds.","The land equivalent ratio describes the relative land area required under sole cropping (monoculture) to produce the same yield as under intercropping (polyculture).","The Area Time Equivalent Ratio (ATER) is a measure of the productivity of an intercropping system. It is calculated by dividing the total yield of the intercrop by the yield of a sole crop grown for the same duration. The ATER is calculated as follows: ATER = (Total yield of intercrop) / (Yield of sole crop grown for the same duration). The ATER is particularly useful in intercropping systems where the crops have different growth durations. For example, if a farmer intercrops a fast-growing crop with a slow-growing crop, the faster-growing crop will produce a yield before the slower-growing crop. The ATER will take into account the different growth durations of the crops and will give a more accurate measure of the overall productivity of the intercropping system.","Change in animal weight relative to a baseline (usually weight at the start of an experiment) over a specified time period.","The total weight of the animal or meat parts of it.","Milk yields.

<p>ERA has a diverse range of practices, from agronomy to livestock and a few papers on postharvest storage. We will therefore focus on Agronomy for this User Guide. If you are interest in livestock practices, please explore our Livestock User Guide (<a href="https://eragriculture.github.io/ERL/Guide-to-Livestock-Data-Analysis-in-the-ERA-Dataset--STATIC.html" class="uri">https://eragriculture.github.io/ERL/Guide-to-Livestock-Data-Analysis-in-the-ERA-Dataset--STATIC.html</a>)</p>
<p>Unhide the code to see how we sub-set the data to agronomy papers only. Product.Type has either Animal or Plant and therefore in this example, we will subset to Plant</p>

<p>We collected country, site name paraphrased from study, and spatial coordinates when given. Location’s coordinates were verified in Google Maps, as they were often inaccurately reported. Enumerators also recorded a measure of spatial uncertainty. When authors reported decimal degrees and there was no correction required to the co-ordinates, then uncertainty was measured in terms of the value’s precision. When the location was estimated using Google Maps, the spatial uncertainty value was measured in terms of the precision of the site location description (e.g., a single farm or region) and the enumerator’s visual interpretation of land use at and near the coordinates. Observation’s geographic coordinates were collected to facilitate linking the data compiled in ERA to external databases, for example related to climatic and environmental factors not necessarily reported in the original study.</p>

<p>The <code>Product.Subtype</code> column in the <code>ERA.Compiled_ag</code> dataset contains the specific <strong>crop types</strong> examined in each study (e.g., <code>"Maize"</code>, <code>"Rice"</code>, <code>"Wheat"</code>).</p>
<p>To accurately <strong>count how many unique studies (identified by <code>Code</code>)</strong> examined each crop, the following code processes and summarizes the data.</p>
<p>The figure below displays the distribution of crop categories in the dataset. It highlights the relative focus of studies across different crop types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>largest category</strong> by far is <strong>Cereals</strong>, indicating that most studies in ERA are focused on cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum.</p></li>
<li><p>This is followed by <strong>Legumes</strong>, <strong>Starchy Staples</strong>, and <strong>Vegetables</strong>, which also appear frequently in the dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Categories such as <strong>Fodders</strong>, <strong>Cash Crops</strong>, and <strong>Fruits</strong> are represented to a lesser extent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each tile represents a crop category, and its size reflects the <strong>number of unique studies</strong> (<code>Code</code>) that included at least one crop from that category. The number in parentheses shows the count of studies for that group.</p>

<p>The following analysis explores the types of <strong>agronomic practices</strong>-referred to as <strong>“Themes”</strong> in the dataset.</p>
<p>Each study in ERA may be associated with multiple practices—for example, a study might examine both Soil Management and Nutrient Management.<br>
For example, the theme ‘Soil Management’ include practices like green manure, crop residue, pH control, tillage, improved fallows. ‘Nutrient Management’ includes organic and inorganic fertilizer. This can be found in the practices within the mastercodes<br>

<p>The following principles assisted in consistent comparisons of treatment outcomes across studies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>New versus common treatment. A new technology versus a control, which is typically farmers’ conventional technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Additive complexity. An improved technology / set of technologies to a simpler option, e.g., agroforestry+fertilizer vs agroforestry alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Agriculture to agriculture. Agricultural systems are never compared to natural systems. For example, we can compare soil organic carbon in mulch versus no mulch systems, but not versus natural or semi-natural vegetation.</p></li>
<li><p>Same implementation levels. Comparisons were made within the same ‘level’ of implementation. For example, 40 kg N/ha was compared with other treatments using 40 kgN/ha but not 20 kgN/ha.</p></li>
<li><p>All treatment details. All major characteristics of the treatments were coded, including seed variety, tillage type, weed control, tree species, and chemical applications, among others, up to 13 labels per treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>In-year comparisons. Only comparisons of treatments and outcomes that occur in the same year or season were included. Residual effects, e.g., of phosphorus applied in year one with yield in year three, were not recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Include all possible treatments. All treatments, and their component technologies, in a study were coded if they formed part of valid comparison.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Based this, a response ratio is calculated by MeanT/MeanC</p>
