# What is ERA?

## Introduction

The *Evidence for Resilient Agriculture* (ERA) initiative was launched in 2012 to address the need for a robust evidence base on how agricultural practices perform under different conditions. Originally developed to evaluate the outcomes of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), ERA has since evolved to include a wide range of technologies and practices relevant to agroecology, regenerative agriculture, ecosystem-based adaptation, and nature-based solutions.

ERA provides a large, structured meta-dataset of agricultural experiments, harmonized using a common data model and controlled vocabulary. The current version of the dataset (version = r era_version) includes r ERA_Compiled\[,.N\] observations from r ERA_Compiled\[,length(unique(Code))\] peer-reviewed agricultural studies conducted in Africa between r ERA_Compiled\[,min(M.Year.Start,na.rm=T)\] and r ERA_Compiled\[!M.Year.End\>2050,max(M.Year.End,na.rm=T)\]. These observations cover more than r ERA_Compiled\[,length(unique(PrName))\] unique combinations of practices, and assess their effects on over r ERA_Compiled\[,length(unique(Out.SubInd))\] outcome indicators, including yield, soil health, and emissions.

Experiments were identified through systematic searches in *Web of Science* and *Scopus* and were screened against predefined criteria: geographic location, technology and outcome relevance, inclusion of both conventional and alternative treatments, and availability of primary data. The extracted data are structured using a detailed Excel-based template, enabling flexible and precise representation of treatments, outcomes, experimental design, and context.

A derived product, the `ERA.Compiled` table, simplifies the dataset into treatment-control comparisons, making it easier to analyze the effects of agricultural interventions. While the compiled table is ideal for quick analysis, it remains linked to the full data model, allowing users to retrieve detailed metadata and contextual information where needed.

## Downloading the data

This section retrieves the most recent version of the ERA.Compiled comparisons table from the ERA S3 bucket, saves it locally, and loads it for use.

```{r pre-load era compiled, echo=T, message=F}
# Set S3 path and initialize
s3 <- s3fs::S3FileSystem$new(anonymous = TRUE)
era_s3 <- "s3://digital-atlas/era"
bundle_dir <- file.path(era_s3, "data", "packaged")

# Get the latest bundle
all_files <- s3$dir_ls(bundle_dir)
latest_bundle <- tail(sort(grep("era_agronomy_bundle.*\\.tar\\.gz$", all_files, value = TRUE)), 1)

# Define download and extraction paths
dl_dir <- "downloaded_data"
dir.create(dl_dir, showWarnings = FALSE)
bundle_local <- file.path(dl_dir, basename(latest_bundle))
extract_dir <- file.path(dl_dir, tools::file_path_sans_ext(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(latest_bundle))))

# Download and extract
if (!file.exists(bundle_local)) {
  s3$file_download(latest_bundle, bundle_local, overwrite = TRUE)
}
if (!dir.exists(extract_dir)) {
  dir.create(extract_dir)
  utils::untar(bundle_local, exdir = extract_dir)
}

# Locate files
json_agronomic <- list.files(extract_dir, pattern = "^agronomic_.*\\.json$", full.names = TRUE)
json_master <- list.files(extract_dir, pattern = "^era_master_codes.*\\.json$", full.names = TRUE)
parquet_file <- list.files(extract_dir, pattern = "^era_compiled.*\\.parquet$", full.names = TRUE)

# Load into variables
ERA_Compiled <- arrow::read_parquet(parquet_file)
agronomic_metadata <- fromJSON(json_agronomic)

```

## Subsetting to Coffee in East Africa

ERA has a diverse range of practices, from agronomy to livestock and a few papers on postharvest storage. We will therefore focus on Coffee (with Maize) in East Africa for this User Guide. If you are interest in the entire dataset, please explore our [Agronomy User Guide](https://eragriculture.github.io/ERA_Agronomy/ERA-User-Guide.html).

```{r subsetting to Coffee, echo=T, message=F}

target_crops <- c("Arabica","Coffee")

# Step 1: Filter by Coffee AND East African countries
coffee_data <- ERA_Compiled %>%
  filter(
    Product.Simple %in% target_crops
  )



# Optional: check the result
DT::datatable(
  coffee_data,
  options = list(
    scrollY = "400px",
    scrollX = TRUE,
    pageLength = 20,
    fixedHeader = FALSE
  )
)
```

## Downloading the meta-data

This section downloads and imports the ERA metadata, that will explain each field in the ERA.Compiled data.

```{r vocad, echo=T, message=F}
# Download the era master vocab ######
era_vocab_url <- "https://github.com/peetmate/era_codes/raw/main/era_master_sheet.xlsx"
era_vocab_local <- file.path(dl_dir, basename(era_vocab_url))
if(!file.exists(era_vocab_local)|update_vocab){
  download.file(era_vocab_url, era_vocab_local, mode = "wb")  # Download and write in binary mode
}
  
# Import the vocab
sheet_names <- readxl::excel_sheets(era_vocab_local)
sheet_names <- sheet_names[!grepl("sheet|Sheet", sheet_names)]

# Read each sheet into a list named era_master_codes
era_master_codes <- sapply(
  sheet_names,
  FUN = function(x) {
    data.table::data.table(readxl::read_excel(era_vocab_local, sheet = x))
  },
  USE.NAMES = TRUE
)

# Access and filter the era_fields_v2 sheet
era_fields_comp = era_master_codes["era_fields_v1"]
metadata<-era_fields_comp$era_fields_v1
metadata<- metadata %>%
  filter(!is.na(Field.Name))

DT::datatable(
  metadata,
  options = list(
    scrollY = "400px",
    scrollX = TRUE,
    pageLength = 20,
    fixedHeader = FALSE
  )
)

```

## Exploring geographic locations of studies available

We collected country, site name paraphrased from study, and spatial coordinates when given. Location's coordinates were verified in Google Maps, as they were often inaccurately reported. Enumerators also recorded a measure of spatial uncertainty. When authors reported decimal degrees and there was no correction required to the co-ordinates, then uncertainty was measured in terms of the value's precision. When the location was estimated using Google Maps, the spatial uncertainty value was measured in terms of the precision of the site location description (e.g., a single farm or region) and the enumerator's visual interpretation of land use at and near the coordinates. Observation's geographic coordinates were collected to facilitate linking the data compiled in ERA to external databases, for example related to climatic and environmental factors not necessarily reported in the original study.

```{r r_plotting the distribution of data, echo=T, message=F}

# ---- Data prep ----
coffee_data <- coffee_data %>%
  mutate(
    Latitude  = as.numeric(Latitude),
    Longitude = as.numeric(Longitude)
  ) %>%

paper_counts <- coffee_data %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(N_Papers = n_distinct(Code), .groups = "drop")

# ---- Load WORLD map (global) ----

  )) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

sites_sf <- st_as_sf(coffee_data, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)

map_data <- world %>%
  dplyr::select(admin, geometry) %>%
  rename(Country = admin) %>%
  left_join(paper_counts, by = "Country")

# ---- Create GLOBAL map ----
map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = map_data, aes(fill = N_Papers), color = "white", linewidth = 0.2) +

## Management practices covered in the dataset

The `PrName` column captures the **management practices** evaluated in each study. Studies were counted using **unique identifiers (`Code`)** so that each study contributes only once per practice.

The figure shows that a small number of practices dominate the evidence base, while many others are represented by relatively few studies, highlighting both areas of concentrated research and remaining evidence gaps. Tile size reflects the **number of unique studies** per practice, with counts shown in parentheses.

```{r r_plotting products, echo=T, message=F}
prname_counts <- coffee_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(PrName)) %>%
  separate_rows(PrName, sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(PrName = trimws(PrName)) %>%   # remove extra spaces
  group_by(PrName) %>%
  summarise(Count = n_distinct(Code), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(label = paste0(PrName, " (", Count, ")"))

prname_tree <- ggplot(prname_counts, aes(area = Count, fill = Count, label = label)) +
  geom_treemap(color = "white") +
  geom_treemap_text(
    colour = "black",
    place = "centre",
    grow = FALSE,
    reflow = TRUE,
    size = 10
  ) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greens", direction = 1, guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Practices (by PrName)")

## Exploring the outcomes reported within studies available

The ERA dataset tracks outcomes of agronomic interventions across several broad categories---called **Pillars**---such as productivity, environmental impact, and more. Each pillar includes more specific **indicators** like *yield*, *GHG emissions*, *soil organic carbon*, and others.

```{r r_plotting Outcomes, echo=T, message=F}
# Aggregate data by pillar and indicator
out_counts <- coffee_data %>%
  mutate(Out.Pillar = trimws(as.character(Out.Pillar))) %>%
  filter(Out.Pillar != "", !is.na(Out.Pillar), !is.na(Out.Ind)) %>%
  group_by(Out.Pillar, Out.Ind) %>%
  summarise(Num_Papers = n_distinct(Code), .groups = "drop") %>%
  rename(Pillar = Out.Pillar, Indicator = Out.Ind)


# Sort indicators within each pillar
out_counts <- out_counts %>%
  arrange(Pillar, Indicator) %>%
  mutate(
    Indicator = factor(Indicator, levels = unique(Indicator)),
    Pillar = factor(Pillar, levels = c("Productivity", "Resilience"))
  )

# Optional: define pillar colors
pillar_colors <- c(
  "Productivity" = "#FFCC66",
  "Resilience" = "#990000"
)

out_counts <- out_counts %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(Pillar), Pillar != "",
    !is.na(Indicator), Indicator != ""
  )


# Plot
bar_plot <- ggplot(out_counts, aes(
  x = Indicator, y = Num_Papers, fill = Pillar
)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.8) +
  labs(
    y = "Number of Papers",
    x = "Outcome Indicator"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pillar_colors, na.value = "gray70") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, max(out_counts$Num_Papers) + 50),
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~Pillar, scales = "free_x", nrow = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)
  )

## Other fields of interest

-   *Understanding when the experiment was done.*

    The `Season.Start` and `Season.End` columns are used to indicate the season in which the experiment was done. Values include 'Long Rains' or 'Short Rains'. In cases where the data extractor uses '1' or '2' it corresponds to the Long and Short rains respectively.

-   *Connecting Climate and Soil information to the location and time of an experiment*

    <https://eragriculture.github.io/ERA_Agronomy/ERA%20Climate%20and%20Soils.html>

    This guide explains how ERA observations are enriched with geospatial climate and soil data; Details data sources, processing scripts, and methods for calculating seasonal indicators like GDD, Eratio, and waterlogging; Includes instructions for accessing pre-processed data from S3 and merging it with the ERA dataset.
